# The cooking file system
 
## Abstract
Even if we live in digital modern times, food is still treated analogically.

To obtain infos about a product we have to read the label squashed in few squared centimeters. The expiration date is just printed on the box and it makes tricky to add more details on what we are eating!

There are thousand of food bloggers, sharing their receipts with videos, textual posts, short IG stories but there is a lack of a standard way to communicate effectively these information. 

Imagine to approach a video receipt from a food blog, download a file and being able to add it to your digital cookbook. Being able to customize the script, add your personal touch and share it with your a friend via chat, email, bluetooth or even publish it on social networks.

The main idea is to propose a standard file extension system for food, ingredients and receipts.

In the same way the `.pdf` extension is associated nowadays to documents and books, `.png` for pictures and `.zip` for archives, we would like to propose a standard file format, `.cook` based on JSON technology, to easily share food information and create a reliable, open-source and easy-to-use tool to built services upon it.
